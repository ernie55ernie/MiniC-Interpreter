# MiniCppInterpreter
<h3>Improving Mini C++</h3>
<p>Each identfier in the source program can be transfered to a integer token.</p>
<p>Map, or perhaps some sort of hashing method or tree structure container can be used to search for identifier.</p>
<p>The target of controll statements, such if, must be enclosed between curly braces.</p>
<h3>Expanding Mini C++</h3>
<h5>Adding new C++ features</h5>
<p>Addition action statement, such as goto, continue, and default in switch.</p>
<p>Additional data types, for example float, double, and long.</p>
<p>Class. (Instantiate objects, handle the concepts of public and private, and add to var_type.)</p>
<p>Pointers. (array, using new, and a pointer to the array should be stored in a new field added to var_type.)</p>
<h5>Adding ancillary features</h5>
<p>Trace facility that displays each token as it is executed.</p>
<p>Display te contents of each variables as the program executes.</p>
<p>Integrated editor.</p>
